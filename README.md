# FinGuard AI – Fraud Detection & Risk Intelligence

FinGuard AI is an intelligent fraud detection and risk assessment system designed to identify fraudulent financial transactions using machine learning and data analytics. The project integrates statistical models, neural networks, and visualization tools to provide real-time insights and decision support for financial institutions.

---

## Overview

Financial fraud has become increasingly sophisticated, making traditional rule-based detection methods insufficient. FinGuard AI leverages data-driven modeling, feature engineering, and anomaly detection to minimize false positives and enhance detection accuracy.

This project focuses on building a scalable and explainable ML pipeline—from data ingestion to deployment—capable of integrating with enterprise systems or APIs.

## Core Objectives

- Detect and classify fraudulent transactions in real-time.
- Analyze customer and transaction behavior patterns.
- Provide interpretable model outputs for transparency.
- Build a modular and deployable ML backend with API endpoints.
- Enable monitoring through a visualization dashboard.
